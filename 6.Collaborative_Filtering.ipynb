    "## Collaborative filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is commonly used for recommender systems. These techniques aim to fill in the missing entries of a user-item assciation matrix. spark.ml supports model-based collaborative filtering, in which users and products are described by a small set of latent factors that can be used to predict missing entries. spark.ml uses the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to learn these latent factors. The implementation in spark.ml has the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* numBlocks is the number of blocks the users and items will be partitioned into in order to parallelize computation (defaults to 10).\n",
    "* rank is the number of latent factors in the model (defaults to 10).\n",
    "* maxIter is the maximum number of iterations to run (defaults to 10).\n",
    "* regParam specifies the regularization parameter in ALS (defaults to 1.0).\n",
    "* implicitPrefs specifies whether to use the explicit feedback ALS variant or one adapted for implicit feedback data (defaults to false which means using explicit feedback).\n",
    "* alpha is a parameter applicable to the implicit feedback variant of ALS that governs the baseline confidence in preference observations (defaults to 1.0).\n",
    "* nonnegative specifies whether or not to use nonnegative constraints for least squares (defaults to false).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The DataFrame-based API for ALS currently only supports integers for user and item ids. Other numeric types are supported for the user and item id columns, but the ids must be within the integer value range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explicit vs. implicit feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard approach to matrix factorization based collaborative filtering treats the entries in the user-item matrix as explicit preferences given by the user to the item, for example, users giving ratings to movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common in many real-world use cases to only have access to implicit feedback (e.g. views, clicks, purchases, likes, shares etc.). The approach used in spark.ml to deal with such data is taken from Collaborative Filtering for implicit Feedback Datasets. Essentially, instead of trying to model the matrix of ratings directly, this approach treats the data as numbers representing the strength in observations of user actions (such as the number of clicks, or the cumulative duration someone spent viewing a movie). Those numbers are then related to the level of confidence in observed user preferences, rather than explicit ratings given to items. The model then tries to find latent factors that can be used to predict the expected preference of a user for an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling of the regularization parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "We scale the regularization parameter regParam in solving each each least squares problem by the number of ratings the user generated in updating user factors, or the number of ratings in updating product factors. This approach is named \"ALS-WR\" and discussed in the paper \"Large-Scale Parallel Collaborative Filtering for the Netfix Prize\". It makes regParam less dependent on the scale of the dataset, so we can apply the best parameter learned from a sampled subset to the full dataset and expect similar performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we load ratings data from the MoviewLens dataset, each row consisting of a user, a movie, a rating and a timestamp. We then train an ALS model which assumes, by default, that the ratings are explicit (implicitPrefs is False). We evaluate the recommendation model by measuring the root-mean-square error of rating prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the ALS Python docs for more details on the API."
