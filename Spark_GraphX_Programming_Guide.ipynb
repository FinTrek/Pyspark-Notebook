    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphX is a new component in Spark for graphs and graph-parallel computation. At a high level, GraphX extends the Spark RDD by introducing a new Graph abstraction: a directed multigraph with properties attached to each vertex and edge. To support graph computation, GraphX exposes a set of fundamental operators (e.g., subgraph, joinVertices, and aggregateMessages) as well as an optimized variant of the Pregel API. In addition, GraphX includes a growing collection of graph algorithms and builders to simplify graph analytics tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started you first need to import Spark and GraphX into your project, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "import org.apache.spark._\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.graphx._\n",
    "// To make some of the examples work we will also need RDD\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not using the Spark shell you will also need a SparkContext. To learn more about getting started with Spark refer to the Spark Quick Start Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Property Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The property graph is a directed multigraph with user defined objects attached to each vertex and edge. A directed multigraph is a directed graph with potentially multiple parallel edges sharing the same source and destination vertex. The ability to support parallel edges simplifies modeling scenarios where there can be multiple relationships (e.g., co-worker and friend) between the same vertices. Each vertex is keyed by a unique 64-bit long identifier (VertexID). GraphX does not impose any ordering constraints on the vertex identifiers. Similarly, edges have corresponding source and destination vertex identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The property graph is parameterized over the vertex (VD) and edge (ED) types. These are the types of the objects associated with each vertex and edge respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GraphX optimizes the representation of vertex and edge types when they are primitive data types (e.g., int, double, etc...) reducing the in memory footprint by storing them in specialized arrays.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases it may be desirable to have vertices with different property types in the same graph. This can be accomplished through inheritance. For example to model users and products as a bipartite graph we might do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "class VertexProperty()\n",
    "case class UserProperty(val name: String) extends VertexProperty\n",
    "case class ProductProperty(val name: String, val price: Double) extends VertexProperty\n",
    "// The graph might then have the type:\n",
    "val graph: Graph[VertexProperty, String] = null\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Like RDDs, property graphs are immutable, distributed, and fault-tolerant. Changes to the values or structure of the graph are accomplished by producing a new graph with the desired changes. Note that substantial parts of the original graph (i.e., unaffected structure, attributes, and indices) are reused in the new graph reducing the cost of this inherently functional data structure. The graph is partitioned across the executors using a range of vertex partitioning heuristics. As with RDDs, each partition of the graph can be recreated on a different machine in the event of a failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logically the property graph corresponds to a pair of typed collections (RDDs) encoding the properties for each vertex and edge. As a consequence, the graph class contains members to access the vertices and edges of the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "class Graph[VD, ED] {\n",
    "    val vertices: VertexRDD[VD]\n",
    "    val edges: EdgeRDD[ED]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes VertexRDD[VD] and EdgeRDD[ED] extend and are optimized versions of RDD[(VertexID, VD)] and RDD[Edge[ED]] respectively. Both VertexRDD[VD] and EdgeRDD[ED] provide additional functionality built around graph computation and leverage internal optimizations. We discuss the VertexRDD and EdgeRDD API in greater detail in the section on vertex and edge RDDs but for now they can be thought of as simply RDDs of the form: RDD[(VertexID, VD)] and RDD[Edge[ED]].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Property Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to construct a property graph consisting of the various collaborators on the GraphX project. The vertex property might contain the username and occupation. We could annotate edges with a string describing the relationships between collaborators:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](attach_graphx/property_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting graph would have the type signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val userGraph: Graph[(String, String), String]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous ways to construct a property graph from raw files, RDDs, and even synthetic generators and these are discussed in more detail in the section on graph builders. Probably the most general method is to use the GraphX object. For example the following code constructs a graph from a collection of RDDs:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Assume the SparkContext has already been constructed\n",
    "val sc: SparkContext\n",
    "// Create an RDD for the vertices\n",
    "val users: RDD[(VertexId, (String, String))] = \n",
    "    sc.parallelize(Array((3L, (\"rxin\", \"student\")), (7L, (\"jgonzal\", \"postdoc\")),\n",
    "                         (5L, (\"franklin\", \"prof\")), (2L, (\"istoica\", \"prof\"))))\n",
    "// Create an RDD for edges\n",
    "val relationships: RDD[Edge[String]] = \n",
    "    sc.parallelize(Array(Edge(3L, 7L, \"collab\"), Edge(5L, 3L, \"advisor\"),\n",
    "                         Edge(2L, 5L, \"colleague\"), Edge(5L, 7L, \"pi\")))\n",
    "// Define a default user in case there are relationship with missing user\n",
    "val defaultUser = (\"John Doe\", \"Missing\")\n",
    "// Build the initial Graph\n",
    "val graph = Graph(users, relationships, defaultUser)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example we make use of the Edge case class. Edges have a srcId and a dstId corresponding to the source and destination vertex identifiers. In addition, the Edge class has an attr member which stores the edge property.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can deconstruct a graph into the respective vertex and edge views by using the graph.vertices and edges members respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val graph: Graph[(String, String), String] // Constructed from above\n",
    "// Count all users which are postdocs\n",
    "graph.vertices.filter { case (id, (name, pos)) => pos == \"postdoc\" }.count\n",
    "// Count all the edges where src > dst\n",
    "graph.edges.filter(e => e.srcId > e.dstId).count\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that graph.vertices retuens an VertexRDD[(String, String)] which extends RDD[(VertexID, (String, String))] and  so we use the scala case expression to deconstruct the tuple. On the other hand, graph.edges returns an EdgeRDD containing Edge[String] objects. We could have also used the case class type constructor as in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "graph.edges.filter { case Edge(src, dst, prop) => src > dst }.count \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the vertex and edge views of the property graph, GraphX also exposes a triplet view. The triplet view logically joins the vertex and edge properties yielding an RDD[EdgeTriplet[VD, ED]] containing instances of the EdgeTriplet class. This join can be expressed in the following SQL expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` SQL\n",
    "SELECT src.id, dst.id, src.attr, e.attr, dst.attr\n",
    "FROM edges AS e LEFT JOIN vertices AS src, vertices AS dst\n",
    "ON e.srcId = src.Id AND e.dstId = dst.Id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or graphically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](attach_graphx/triplet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The EdgeTriplet class extends the Edge class by adding the srcAttr and dstAttr members which contain the source and destination properties respectively. We can use the triplet view of a graph to render a collection of strings describing relationships between users.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val graph: Graph[(String, String), String] // Constructed from above\n",
    "// Use the triplets view to create an RDD fo facts.\n",
    "val facts: RDD[String] = \n",
    "    graph.triplets.map(triplet =>\n",
    "        triplet.srcAttr._1 + \" is the \" + triplet.attr + \" of \" + triplet.dstAttr._1)\n",
    "facts.collect.foreach(println(_))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Graph Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as RDDs have basic operations like map, filter, and reduceByKey, property graphs also have a collection of basic operators that take user defined functions and produce new graphs with transformed properties and structure. The core operators that have optimized inplementations are defined in Graph and convenient operators that are expressed as a compositions of the core operators are defined in GraphOps. However, thanks to Scala implicits the operators in GraphOps are automatically available as members of Graph. For example, we can compute the in-degree of each vertex (defined in GraphOps) by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val graph: Graph[(String, String), String]\n",
    "// Use the implicit GraphOps.inDegrees operator\n",
    "val inDegrees: VertexRDD[Int] = graph.inDegrees\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for differentiating between core graph operations and GraphOps is to be able to support different graph representations in the future. Each graph representation must provide implementations of the core operations and reuse many of the useful operations defined in GraphOps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary List of Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a quick summary of the functionality defined in both Graph and GraphOps but presented as members of Graph for simplicity. Note that some function signatures have been simplified (e.g., default arguments and type constraints removed) and some more advanced functionality has been removed so please consult the API docs for the official list of operations.\n",
