    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Kinesis, or TCP sockets, and can be processed using complex algorithms expressed with high level functions like map, reduce, join and window. Finally, processed data can be pushed out to filesystems, databases, and live dashboards.In fact, you can apply Spark's machine learning and graph processing algorithms on data streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/spark_streaming.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, it works as follows. Spark Streaming receives live input data streams and divides the data into batches, which are then processed by the Spark engine to generate the final stream of results in batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/internal_workflow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark Streaming provides a high-level abstraction called discretized stream or DStream, which represents a continuous stream of data. DStreams can be created either from input data streams from sources such as Kafka, Flume, and Kinesis, or by applying high-level operations on other DStreams. Internally, a DStream is represented as a sequence of RDDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows you how to start writing Spark Streaming programs with DStreams. You can write Spark Streaming programs in Scala, Java or Python (introduced in Spark 1.2), Scala version is represented in this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Quick Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go into the details of how to write your own Spark Streaming program, let's take a quick look at what a simple Spark Streaming programs looks like. Let's say we want to count the number of words in text data received from a data server listening on a TCP socket. All you need to do is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the names of the Spark Streaming classes and some implicit conversions from StreamingContext into our environment in order to add useful methods to other classes we need (like DStream). StreamingContext is the main entry point for all streaming functionality. We create a local StreamingContext with two execution threads, and a batch interval of 1 second.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "import org.apache.spark._\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.streaming._\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext._ // not necessary since Spark 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a local StreamingContext with two working thread and batch interval of 1 second.\n",
    "// The master requires 2 cores to prevent from a starvation scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "val conf = new SparkConf().setMaster(\"local[2]\").setAppName(\"NetworkWordCount\")\n",
    "val ssc = new StreamingContext(conf, Seconds(1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this context, we can create a DStream that represents streaming data from a TCP source, specified as hostname (e.g. localhost) and port (e.g. 9999).\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Create a DStream that will connect to hostname:port, like localhost:9999\n",
    "val lines = ssc.socketTextStream(\"localhost\", 9999)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This lines DStream represents the stream of data that will be received from the data server. Each record in this DStream is a line of text. Next, we want to split the lines by space characters into words.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Split each line into words\n",
    "val words = lines.flatMap(_.split(\" \"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "flatMap is a one-to-many DStream operation that creates a new DStream by generating multiple new records from each record in the source DStream. In this case, each line will be split into multiple words and the stream of words is represented as the words DStream. Next, we want to count these words.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Count each word in each batch\n",
    "val pairs = words.map(word => (word, 1))\n",
    "val wordCounts = pairs.reduceByKey(_ + _)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Print the first ten elements of each RDD generated in this DStream to the console\n",
    "wordCounts.print()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The words DStream is further mapped (one-to-one transformation) to a DStream of (word, 1) pairs, which is then reduced to get the frequency of words in each batch of data. Finally, wordCounts.print() will print a few of the counts generated every second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when these lines are executed, Spark Streaming only sets up the computation it will perform when it is started, and no real processing has started yet. To start the processing after all the transformations have been setup, we finally call\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "ssc.start()             // Start the computation\n",
    "ssc.awaitTermination()  // Wait for the computation to terminate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete code can be found in the Spark Straming example NetworkWordCount.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have already downloaded and built Spark, you can run this example as follows. You will first need to run Netcat (a small utility found in most Unix-like systems)as a data server by using\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "nc -lk 9999\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in a different terminal, you can start the example by using\n",

    "```\n",
    "./bin/run-example streaming.NetworkWordCount localhost 9999\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "# Basic Concpets\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we move beyond the simple example and elaborate on the basics of Spark Streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linking\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Spark, Spark Streaming is available through Maven Central. To write your own Spark Streaming program, you will have to add the following dependency to your Maven project.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<dependency>\n",
    "    <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>\n",
    "    <artifactId>spark-streaming-2.11</artifactId>\n",
    "    <version>2.0.2</version>\n",
    "</dependency>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For ingesting data from sources like Kafka, Flume, and Kinesis that are not present in the Spark Streaming core API, you will have to add the corresponding artifact spark-streaming-xyz_2.11 to the dependencies. For example, some of the common ones are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/dependencies.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For an up-to-date list, please refer to the Maven repository for the full list of supported sources and artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initializing StreamingContext\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize a Spark Streaming program, a StreamingContext object has to be created which is the main entry point of all Spark Streaming functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "A StreamingContext object can be created from a SparkConf object.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "import org.apache.spark._\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.streaming._\n",
    "\n",
    "val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(appName).setMaster(master)\n",
    "val ssc = new StreamingContext(conf, Seconds(1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The appName parameter is a name for your application to show on the cluster UI. master is a Spark, Mesos or YARN cluster URL, or a special \"local[\\*]\" string to run in local mode. In practice, when running on a cluster, you will not want to hardcode master in the program, but rather launch the application with spark-submit and receive it there. However, for local testing and unit tests, you can pass \"local[\\*]\" to run Spark Streaming in-process (detects the number of cores in the local system). Note that this internally creates a SparkContext (starting point of all Spark functionality) which can be accessed as ssc.SparkContext.\n",
    "\n",
    "The batch interval must be set based on the latency requirements of your application and available cluster resources. See the Performance Tuning section for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "A StreamingContext object can also be created from an existing SparkContext object.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.streaming._\n",
    "\n",
    "val sc = ...    // existing SparkContext\n",
    "val ssc = new StreamingContext(sc, Seconds(1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After a context is defined, you have to do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the input sources by creating input DStreams.\n",
    "2. Define the streaming computations by applying transformation and output operations to DStreams.\n",
    "3. Start receiving data and processing it using streamingContext.start().\n",
    "4. Wait for the processing to be stopped (manually or due to any error) using streamingContext.awaitTermination().\n",
    "5. The processing can be manually stopped using streamingContext.stop().\n",
    "\n",
    "**Points to remember:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once a context has been started, no new streaming computations can be set up or added to it.\n",
    "* Once a context has been stopped, it cannot be restarted.\n",
    "* Only one StreamingContext can be active in a JVM at the same time.\n",
    "* stop() on StreamingContext also stops the SparkContext. To stop only the StreamingContext, set the optional parameter of stop() called stopSparkContext to false.\n",
    "* A SparkContext can be re-used to create multiple StreamingContexts, as long as the previous StreamingContext is stopped (without stopping the SparkContext) before the next StreamingContext is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discretized Streams (DStreams)\n",
    "\n",
    "Discretized Stream or DStream is the basic abstraction provided by Spark Streaming. It represents a continuous stream of data, either the input data stream received from source, or the processed data stream generated by transforming the input stream. Internally, a DStream is represented by a continuous series of RDDs, which is Spark's abstraction of an immutable, distributed dataset. Each RDD in a DStream contains data from a certain interval, as shown in the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/DStream.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any operation applied on a DStream translates to operations on the underlying RDDs. For example, in the earlier example of converting a stream of lines to words, the flatMap operation is applied on each RDD in the lines DStream to generate the RDDs of the words DStream. This is shown in the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/DStream_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These underlying RDD transformations are computed by the Spark engine. The DStream operations hide most of these details and provide the developer with a higher-level API for convenience. These operations are discussed in detail in later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input DStreams and Receivers\n",
    "\n",
    "Input DStreams are DStreams representing the stream of input data received from streaming sources. In the quick example, lines was an input DStream as it represented the stream of data received from the netcat server. Every input DStream (except file stream, discussed later in this section) is associated with a **Receiver** object which receives the data from a source and stores it in Spark's memory for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark Streaming provides two categories of built-in streaming sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basic sources: Sources directly available in the StreamingContext API. Examples: file systems, and socket connections.\n",
    "* Advanced sources: Sources like Kafka, Flume, Kinesis, etc. are available through extra utility classes. These require linking against extra dependencies as discussed in the linking section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to discuss some of the sources present in each category later in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, if you want to receive multiple streams of data in parallel in your streaming application, you can create multiple input DStreams (discussed further in the Performance Tuning section). This will create multiple receivers which will simultaneously receive multiple data streams. But note that a Spark worker/executor is a long-running task, hence it occupies one of the cores allocated to the Spark Streaming application. Therefore, it is important to remember that a SparkStreaming application needs to be allocated enough cores (or threads, if running locally) to process the received data, as well as to run the receiver(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Points to remember**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When running a Spark Streaming program locally, do not use \"local\" or \"local[1]\" as the master URL. Either of these means that only one thread will be used for running tasks locally. If you are using an input DStream based on a receiver (e.g. sockets, Kafka, Flume, etc.), then the single thread will be used to run the receiver, leaving no thread for processing the received data. Hence, when running locally, always use \"local[n]\" as the master URL, where n > number of receivers to run (see Spark Properties for informations on how to set the master).\n",
    "* Extending the logic to running on a cluster, the number of cores allocated to the Spark Streaming application must be more than the number of receivers. Otherwise the system will receive data, but not be able to process it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already taken a look at the ssc.socketTextStream(...) in the quick exmaple which creates a DStream from text data received over a TCP socket connection. Besides sockets, the StreamingContext API provides methods for creating DStreams from files as input sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**File Streams**: For reading data from files on any file system compatible with the HDFS API (that is, HDFS, S3, NFS, etc), a DStream can be created as:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "streamingContext.fileStream[KeyClass, ValueClass, InputFormatClass](dataDirectory)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Spark Streaming will monitor the directory dataDirectory and process any files created in that directory (files written in nested directory not supported). Note that\n",
    "\n",
    "* The files must have the same data format.\n",
    "* The files must be created in the dataDirectory by atomically moving or renaming them into the data directory.\n",
    "* Once moved, the files must not be changed. So if the files are being continuously appended, the new data will not be read.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple text files, there is an easier method streamingContext.textFileStream(dataDirectory). And file streams do not require running a receiver, hence does not require allocating cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python API: fileStream is not available in the Python API, only textFileStream is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Streams based on Custom Receivers**: DStreams can be created with data streams received through custom receivers. See the Custom Receiver Guide for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Queue of RDDs as a Stream**: For testing a Spark Streaming application with test data, one can also create a DStream based on a queue of RDDs, using streamingContext.queueStream(queueOfRDDs). Each RDD pushed into the queue will be treated as a batch of data in the DStream, and processed like a stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on streams from sockets and files, see the API documentations of the relevant functions in StreamingContext for Scala, JavaStreamingContext for Java, and StreamingContext for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Python API: As of Spark 2.0.2, out of these sources, Kafka, Kinesis and Flume are available in the Python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This category of sources require interfacing with external non-Spark libraries, some of them with complex dependencies (e.g. Kafka and Flume). Hence, to minimize issues related to version conflicts of dependencies, the functionality to create DStreams from these sources has been moved to separate libraries that can be linked to explicitly when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these advanced sources are not available in the Spark shell, hence applications based on these advanced sources cannot be tested in the shell. If you really want to use them in the Spark shell you will have to download the corresponding Maven artifact's JAR along with its dependencies and add it to the classpath.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these advanced sources are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Kafka: Spark Streaming 2.0.2 is compatible with Kafka broker versions 0.8.2.1 or higher. See the Kafka Integration Guide for more details.\n",
    "* Flume: Spark Streaming 2.0.2 is compatible with Flume 1.6.0. See the Flume Integration Guide for more details.\n",
    "* Kinesis: Spark Streaming 2.0.2 is compatible with Kinesis Client Library 1.2.1. See the Kinesis Integration Guide for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Python API: This is not yet supported in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input DStreams can also be created out of custom data sources. All you have to do is implement a user-defined **receiver** (see next section to understand what that is) that can receive data from the custom sources and push it into Spark. See the Custom Receiver Guide for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Receiver Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be two kinds of data sources based on their reliability. Sources (like Kafka and Flume) allow the transferred data to be acknowledged. If the system receiving data from these reliable sources acknowledges the received data correctly, it can be ensured that no data will be lost due to any kind of failure. This leads to two kinds of receivers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reliable Receiver - A reliable receiver correctly sends acknowledgment to a reliable source when the data has been received and stored in Spark with replication.\n",
    "2. Unreliable Receiver - An unreliable receiver does not send acknowledgment to a source. This can be used for sources that do not support acknowledgment, or even for reliable sources when one does not want or need to go into the complexity of acknowledgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of how to write a reliable receiver are discussed in the Custom Receiver Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformations on DStreams\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to that of RDDs, transformations allow the data from the input DStream to be modified. DStreams support many of the transformations available on normal Spark RDD's. Some of the common ones are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/transformations_on_DStreams.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A few of these transformations are worth discussing in more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### UpdateStateByKey Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "The updateStateByKey operation allows you to maintain arbitrary state while continuously updating it with new information. To use this, you will have to do two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the state - The state can be an arbitrary data type.\n",
    "2. Define the state update function - Specify with a function how to update the state using the previous state and the new values from an input stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every batch, Spark will apply the state update function for all existing keys, regardless of whether they have new data in a batch or not. If the update function returns None then the key-value pair will be eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate this with an example. Say you want to maintain a running count of each word seen in a text data stream. Here, the running count is the state and it is an integer. We define the update function as:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "def updateFunction(newValues: Seq[Int], runningCount: Option[Int]): Option[Int] = {\n",
    "    val newCount = ...    // add the new values with the previous running count to get the new count\n",
    "    Some(newCount)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is applied on a DStream containing words (say, the pairs DStream containing (word, 1) pairs in the earlier example).\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val runningCounts = pairs.updateStateByKey[Int](updateFunction _)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The update function will be called for each word, with newValues having a sequence of 1's (from the (word, 1) pairs) and the runningCount having the previous count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using updateStateByKey requires the checkpoint directory to be configured, which is discussed in detail in the checkpointing section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transform Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "The transform operation (along with its variations like transformWith) allows arbitrary RDD-to-RDD functions to be applied on a DStream. It can be used to apply any RDD operation that is not exposed in the DStream API. For example, the functionality of joining every batch in a data stream with another dataset is not directly exposed in the DStream API. However, you can easily use transform to do this. This enables very powerful possibilities. For example, one can do real-time data cleaning by joining the input data stream with precomputed spam information (maybe generated with Spark as well) and then filtering based on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val spamInfoRDD = ssc.sparkContext.newAPIHadoopRDD(...) // RDD containing spam information\n",
    "\n",
    "val cleanedDStream = wordCounts.transform(rdd => {\n",
    "    rdd.join(spamInfoRDD).filter(...) // join data stream with spam information to do data cleaning\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the supplied function gets called in every batch interval. This allows you to do time-varying RDD operations, that is, RDD operations, number of partitions, broadcast variables, etc. can be changed between batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Window Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark Streaming also provides windowed computations, which allow you to apply transformations over a sliding window of data. The following figure illustrates this sliding window.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/window.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the figure, every time the window slides over a source DStream, the source RDDs that fall within the window are combined and operated upon to produce the RDDs of the windowed DStream. In this specific case, the operation is applied over the last 3 time units of data, and slides by 2 time units. This shows that any window operation needs to specify two parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* window length - The duration of the window (3 in the figure).\n",
    "* sliding interval - The interval at which operation is performed (2 in the figure).\n",
    "\n",
    "These two parameters must be multiples of the batch interval of the source DStream (1 in the figure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the window operations with an example. Say, you want to extend the earlier example by generating word counts over the last 30 seconds of data, every 10 seconds. To do this, we have to apply the reduceByKey operation on the pairs DStream of (word, 1) pairs over the last 30 seconds of data. This is done using the operation reduceByKeyAndWindow.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Reduce last 30 seconds of data, every 10 seconds\n",
    "val windowedWordCounts = pairs.reduceByKeyAndWindow((a:Int, b:Int) => (a + b), Seconds(30), Seconds(10))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common window operations are as follows. All of these operations take the said two parameters - windowLength and slideInterval.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/window_operation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Join Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, its worth highlighting how easily you can perform different kinds of joins in Spark Streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stream-stream joins**\n",
    "\n",
    "Streams can be very easily joined with other streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val stream1: DStream[String, String] = ...\n",
    "val stream2: DStream[String, String] = ...\n",
    "val joinedStream = stream1.join(stream2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, in each batch interval, the RDD generated by stream1 will be joined with the RDD generated by stream2. You can also do leftOuterJoin, rightOuterJoin, fullOuterJoin. Furthermore, it is often very useful to do joins over windows of the streams. That is pretty easy as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val windowedStream1 = stream1.window(Seconds(20))\n",
    "val windowedStream2 = stream2.window(Minutes(1))\n",
    "val joinedStream = windowedStream1.join(windowedStream2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stream-dataset joins**\n",
    "\n",
    "This has already been shown earlier while explain DStream.transform operation. Here is yet another example of joining a windowed stream with a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val dataset: RDD[String, String] = ...\n",
    "val windowedStream = stream.window(Seconds(20))...\n",
    "val joinedStream = windowedStream.transform { rdd => rdd.join(dataset) }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you can also dynamically change the dataset you want to join against. The function provided to transform is evaluated every batch interval and therefore will use the current dataset that dataset reference points to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete list of DStream transformations is available in the API documentation. For the Scala API, see DStream and PairDStreamFunctions. For the Java API, see JavaDStream and JavaPairDStream. For the Python API, see DStream.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Operations on DStreams\n",
    "\n",
    "Output operations allow DStream's data to be pushed out to external systems like a database or a file systems. Since the output operations actually allow the transformed data to be consumed by external systems, they trigger the actual execution of all the DStream transformations (similar to actions for RDDs). Currently, the following output operations are defined:\n",
