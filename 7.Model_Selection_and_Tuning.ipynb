    "# ML Tuning: model selection and hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes how to use MLlib's tooling for tuning ML algorithms and Pipelines. Built-in Cross-Validation and other tooling allow users to optimize hyperparameters in algorithms and Pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model selection (a.k.a. hyperparameter tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "An important task in ML is model selection, or using data to find the best model or parameters for given task. This is also called tuning. Tuning may be done for individual Estimators such as LogisticRegression, or for entire Pipelines which include multiple algorithms, featurization, and other steps. Users can tune an entire Pipeline at once, rather than tuning each element in the Pipeline separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLlib supports model selection using tools such as CrossValidator and TrainValidationSplit. These tools require the following items:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Estimator: algorithm or Pipeline to tune\n",
    "* Set of ParamMaps: parameters to choose from, sometimes called a \"parameter grid\" to search over\n",
    "* Evaluator: metric to measure how well a fitted Model does on held-out test data\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, these model selection tools work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They split the input data into separate training and test datasets.\n",
    "* For each (training, test) pair, they iterate through the set of ParamMaps: For each ParamMap, they fit the Estimator using those parameters, get the fitted Model, and evaluate the Model's performance using the Evaluator.\n",
    "* They select the Model produced by the best-performing set of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Evaluator can be a RegressionEvaluator for regression problems, a BinaryClassificationEvaluator for binary data, or a MulticlassClassificationEvaluator for multiclass problems. The default metric used to choose the best ParamMap can be overridden by the setMetricName method in each of these evaluators.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help construct the parameter grid, users can use the ParamGridBuilder utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "CrossValidator begins by splitting the dataset into a set of folds which are used as separate training and test datasets. E.g., with k=3 folds, CrossValidator will generate 3 (training, test) dataset pairs, each of which uses 2/3 of the data for training and 1/3 for testing. To evaluate a particular ParamMap, CrossValidator computes the average evaluation metric for the 3 Models produced by fitting the Estimator on the 3 different (training, test) dataset pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "After identifying the best ParamMap, CrossValidator finally re-fits the Estimator using the best ParamMap and the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: model selection via cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates using CrossValidator to select from a grid of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that cross-validation over a grid of parameters is expensive. E.g., in the example below, the parameter grid has 3 values for hashingTF.numFeatures and 2 values for lr.regParam, and CrossValidator uses 2 folds. This multiplies out to (3×2)×2=12 different models being trained. In realistic settings, it can be common to try many more parameters and use more folds (k=3 and k=10 are common). In other words, using CrossValidator can be very expensive. However, it is also a well-established method for choosing parameters which is more statistically sound than heuristic hand-tuning."
