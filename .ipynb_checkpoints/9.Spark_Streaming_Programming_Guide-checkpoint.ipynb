    "Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Kinesis, or TCP sockets, and can be processed using complex algorithms expressed with high-level functions like map, reduce, join, and window. Finally, processed data can be pushed out to filesystems, databases, and live dashboards. In fact, you can apply Spark's machine learning and graph processing algorithms on data streams.\n",

    "![](9.attach_files/spark_streaming.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, it works as follows. Spark Streaming receives live input data streams and divides the data into batches, which are then processed by the Spark engine to generate the final stream of results in batches.\n",

    "Spark Streaming provides a high-level abstraction called discretized stream or DStream, which represents a continuous stream of data. DStreams can be created either from input data streams from sources such as Kafka, Flume, and Kinesis, or by applying high-level operations on other DStreams. Internally, a DStream is represented as a sequence of RDDs.\n",

Let's say we want to count the number of words in text data received from a data server listening on a TCP socket. All you need to do is as follows.\n",
