    "\n",
    "Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is a feature vectorization method widely used in text mining to reflect the importance of a term to a document in the corpus. Denote a term by t, a document by d, and the corpus by D. Term frequency TF(t, d) is the number of times that term t appears in document d, while document frequency DF(t, D) is the number of documents that contains term t. If we only use term frequency to measure the importance, it is very easy to over-emphasize terms that appear very often but carry little information about the document, e.g. \"a\", \"the\", and \"of\". If a term appears very often across the corpus, it means it doesn't carry special information about a particular document. Inverse document frequency is a numerical measure of how much information a term provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](3.attach_files/IDF.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "where |D| is the total number of documents in the corpus. Since logarithm is used, if a term appears in all documents, its IDF value become 0. Note that a smoothing term is applied to avoid dividing by zero for terms outside the corpus. The TF-IDF measure is simply the product of TF and IDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](3.attach_files/TF-IDF.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several variants on the definition of term frequency and document frequency. In MLlib, we separate TF and IDF to make them flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF: Both HashingTF and CountVectorizer can be used to generate the term frequency vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "HashingTF is a Transformer which takes sets of terms and converts those sets into fixed-length feature vectors. In text processing, a \"set of terms\" might be a bag of words. HashingTF utilizes the hashing trick. A raw feature is mapped into an index (term) by applying a hash function. The hash function used here is MurmurHash 3. Then term frequencies are calculated based on the mapped indices. This approach avoids the need to compute a global term-to-index map, which can be expensive for a large corpus, but it suffers from potential hash collisions, where different raw features may become the same term after hashing. To reduce the chance of collision, we can increase the target feature dimension, i.e. the number of buckets of the hash table. Since a simple modulo is used to transform the hash function to a column index, it is advisable to use a power of two as the feature dimension, otherwise the features will not be mapped evenly to the columns. The default feature dimension is 2^18=262,144. An optional binary toggle parameter controls term frequency counts. When set to true all nonzero frequency counts are set to 1. This is especially useful for discrete probabilistic models that model binary, rather than integer, counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "CountVectorizer converts text documents to vectors of term counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF: IDF is an Estimator which is fit on a dataset and produces an IDFModel. The IDFModel takes feature vectors (generally created from HashingTF or CountVectorizer) and scales each column. Intuitively, it down-weights columns which appear frequently in a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: spark.ml doesn't provide tools for text segmentation. We refer users to the Stanford NLP Group and scalanlp/chalk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code segment, we start with a set of sentences. We split each sentence into words using Tokenizer. For each sentence (bag of words), we use HashingTF to hash the sentence into a feature vector. We use IDF to rescale the feature vectors; this generally improves performance when using text as features. Our feature vectors could then be passed to a learning algorithm.\n",
