    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphX is a new component in Spark for graphs and graph-parallel computation. At a high level, GraphX extends the Spark RDD by introducing a new Graph abstraction: a directed multigraph with properties attached to each vertex and edge. To support graph computation, GraphX exposes a set of fundamental operators (e.g., subgraph, joinVertices, and aggregateMessages) as well as an optimized variant of the Pregel API. In addition, GraphX includes a growing collection of graph algorithms and builders to simplify graph analytics tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started you first need to import Spark and GraphX into your project, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "import org.apache.spark._\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.graphx._\n",
    "// To make some of the examples work we will also need RDD\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not using the Spark shell you will also need a SparkContext. To learn more about getting started with Spark refer to the Spark Quick Start Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Property Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The property graph is a directed multigraph with user defined objects attached to each vertex and edge. A directed multigraph is a directed graph with potentially multiple parallel edges sharing the same source and destination vertex. The ability to support parallel edges simplifies modeling scenarios where there can be multiple relationships (e.g., co-worker and friend) between the same vertices. Each vertex is keyed by a unique 64-bit long identifier (VertexID). GraphX does not impose any ordering constraints on the vertex identifiers. Similarly, edges have corresponding source and destination vertex identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The property graph is parameterized over the vertex (VD) and edge (ED) types. These are the types of the objects associated with each vertex and edge respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GraphX optimizes the representation of vertex and edge types when they are primitive data types (e.g., int, double, etc...) reducing the in memory footprint by storing them in specialized arrays.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases it may be desirable to have vertices with different property types in the same graph. This can be accomplished through inheritance. For example to model users and products as a bipartite graph we might do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "class VertexProperty()\n",
    "case class UserProperty(val name: String) extends VertexProperty\n",
    "case class ProductProperty(val name: String, val price: Double) extends VertexProperty\n",
    "// The graph might then have the type:\n",
    "val graph: Graph[VertexProperty, String] = null\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Like RDDs, property graphs are immutable, distributed, and fault-tolerant. Changes to the values or structure of the graph are accomplished by producing a new graph with the desired changes. Note that substantial parts of the original graph (i.e., unaffected structure, attributes, and indices) are reused in the new graph reducing the cost of this inherently functional data structure. The graph is partitioned across the executors using a range of vertex partitioning heuristics. As with RDDs, each partition of the graph can be recreated on a different machine in the event of a failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logically the property graph corresponds to a pair of typed collections (RDDs) encoding the properties for each vertex and edge. As a consequence, the graph class contains members to access the vertices and edges of the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "class Graph[VD, ED] {\n",
    "    val vertices: VertexRDD[VD]\n",
    "    val edges: EdgeRDD[ED]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes VertexRDD[VD] and EdgeRDD[ED] extend and are optimized versions of RDD[(VertexID, VD)] and RDD[Edge[ED]] respectively. Both VertexRDD[VD] and EdgeRDD[ED] provide additional functionality built around graph computation and leverage internal optimizations. We discuss the VertexRDD and EdgeRDD API in greater detail in the section on vertex and edge RDDs but for now they can be thought of as simply RDDs of the form: RDD[(VertexID, VD)] and RDD[Edge[ED]].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Property Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to construct a property graph consisting of the various collaborators on the GraphX project. The vertex property might contain the username and occupation. We could annotate edges with a string describing the relationships between collaborators:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](attach_graphx/property_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting graph would have the type signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val userGraph: Graph[(String, String), String]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous ways to construct a property graph from raw files, RDDs, and even synthetic generators and these are discussed in more detail in the section on graph builders. Probably the most general method is to use the GraphX object. For example the following code constructs a graph from a collection of RDDs:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Assume the SparkContext has already been constructed\n",
    "val sc: SparkContext\n",
    "// Create an RDD for the vertices\n",
    "val users: RDD[(VertexId, (String, String))] = \n",
    "    sc.parallelize(Array((3L, (\"rxin\", \"student\")), (7L, (\"jgonzal\", \"postdoc\")),\n",
    "                         (5L, (\"franklin\", \"prof\")), (2L, (\"istoica\", \"prof\"))))\n",
    "// Create an RDD for edges\n",
    "val relationships: RDD[Edge[String]] = \n",
    "    sc.parallelize(Array(Edge(3L, 7L, \"collab\"), Edge(5L, 3L, \"advisor\"),\n",
    "                         Edge(2L, 5L, \"colleague\"), Edge(5L, 7L, \"pi\")))\n",
    "// Define a default user in case there are relationship with missing user\n",
    "val defaultUser = (\"John Doe\", \"Missing\")\n",
    "// Build the initial Graph\n",
    "val graph = Graph(users, relationships, defaultUser)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example we make use of the Edge case class. Edges have a srcId and a dstId corresponding to the source and destination vertex identifiers. In addition, the Edge class has an attr member which stores the edge property.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can deconstruct a graph into the respective vertex and edge views by using the graph.vertices and edges members respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val graph: Graph[(String, String), String] // Constructed from above\n",
    "// Count all users which are postdocs\n",
    "graph.vertices.filter { case (id, (name, pos)) => pos == \"postdoc\" }.count\n",
    "// Count all the edges where src > dst\n",
    "graph.edges.filter(e => e.srcId > e.dstId).count\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that graph.vertices retuens an VertexRDD[(String, String)] which extends RDD[(VertexID, (String, String))] and  so we use the scala case expression to deconstruct the tuple. On the other hand, graph.edges returns an EdgeRDD containing Edge[String] objects. We could have also used the case class type constructor as in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "graph.edges.filter { case Edge(src, dst, prop) => src > dst }.count \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the vertex and edge views of the property graph, GraphX also exposes a triplet view. The triplet view logically joins the vertex and edge properties yielding an RDD[EdgeTriplet[VD, ED]] containing instances of the EdgeTriplet class. This join can be expressed in the following SQL expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` SQL\n",
    "SELECT src.id, dst.id, src.attr, e.attr, dst.attr\n",
    "FROM edges AS e LEFT JOIN vertices AS src, vertices AS dst\n",
    "ON e.srcId = src.Id AND e.dstId = dst.Id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or graphically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](attach_graphx/triplet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The EdgeTriplet class extends the Edge class by adding the srcAttr and dstAttr members which contain the source and destination properties respectively. We can use the triplet view of a graph to render a collection of strings describing relationships between users.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val graph: Graph[(String, String), String] // Constructed from above\n",
    "// Use the triplets view to create an RDD fo facts.\n",
    "val facts: RDD[String] = \n",
    "    graph.triplets.map(triplet =>\n",

    "facts.collect.foreach(println(_))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Graph Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as RDDs have basic operations like map, filter, and reduceByKey, property graphs also have a collection of basic operators that take user defined functions and produce new graphs with transformed properties and structure. The core operators that have optimized inplementations are defined in Graph and convenient operators that are expressed as a compositions of the core operators are defined in GraphOps. However, thanks to Scala implicits the operators in GraphOps are automatically available as members of Graph. For example, we can compute the in-degree of each vertex (defined in GraphOps) by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val graph: Graph[(String, String), String]\n",
    "// Use the implicit GraphOps.inDegrees operator\n",
    "val inDegrees: VertexRDD[Int] = graph.inDegrees\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for differentiating between core graph operations and GraphOps is to be able to support different graph representations in the future. Each graph representation must provide implementations of the core operations and reuse many of the useful operations defined in GraphOps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary List of Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a quick summary of the functionality defined in both Graph and GraphOps but presented as members of Graph for simplicity. Note that some function signatures have been simplified (e.g., default arguments and type constraints removed) and some more advanced functionality has been removed so please consult the API docs for the official list of operations.\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these operators yields a new graph with the vertex or edge properties modified by the user defined map function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in each case the graph structure is unaffected. This is a key feature of these operators which allows the resulting graph to reuse the structural indices of the original graph. The following snippets are logically equivalent, but the first one does not preserve the structural indices and would not benefit from the GraphX system optimizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val newVertices = graph.vertices.map { case (id, attr) => (id, mapUdf(id, attr)) }\n",
    "val newGraph = Graph(newVertices, graph.edges)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, use mapVertices to preserve the indices:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val newGraph = graph.mapVertices((id, attr) => mapUdf(id, attr))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators are often used to initialize the graph for particular computation or project away unnecessary properties. For example, given a graph with the out degrees as the vertex properties (we describe how to construct such a graph later), we initialize it for PageRank:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Given a graph where the vertex property is the out degree\n",

    "## Structural Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently GraphX supports only a simple set of commonly used structural operators and we expect to add more in the future. The following is a list of the basic structural operators.\n",
    "\n",

    "The reverse operator returns a new graph with all the edge directions reversed. This can be useful when, for example, trying to compute the inverse PageRank. Because the reverse operation dose not modify vertex or edge properties or change the number of edges, it can be implemented efficiently without data movement or duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subgraph operator takes vertex and edge predicates and returns the graph containing only the vertices that satisfy the vertex predicate (evaluate to true) and edges that satisfy the edge predicate and connect vertices that satisfy the vertex predicate. The subgraph operator can be used in number of situations to restrict the graph to the vertices and edges of interest or eliminate broken links.

    "\n",
    "In many cases it is necessary to join data from external collections (RDDs) with graphs. For example, we might have extra user properties that we want to merge with an existing graph or we might want to pull vertex properties from one graph into another.

    "\n",
    "Note that if the RDD contains more than one value for a given vertex only one will be used. It is therefore recommended that the input RDD be made unique using the following which will also pre-index the resulting values to substantially accelerate the subsequent join.\n",

For example, we can setup a graph for PageRank by initializing vertex properties with their outDegree.\n",

    "## Neighborhood Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "A key step in many graph analytics tasks is aggregating information about the neighborhood of each vertex. For example, we might want to know the number of followers each user has or the average age of the followers of each user. Many iterative graph algorithms (e.g., PageRank, Shortest Path, and connected components) repeatedly aggregate properties of neighboring vertices (e.g., current PageRank Value, shortest path to the source, and smallest reachable vertex id).\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve performance the primary aggregation operator changed from graph.mapReduceTriplets to the new graph.aggregateMessages. While the changes in the API are relatively small, we provide a transition guide below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregate Messages (aggregateMessages)\n",
    "\n",
    "The core aggregation operation in GraphX is aggregateMessages. This operator applies a user defined sendMsg function to each edge triplet in the graph and then uses the mergeMsg function to aggregate those messages at their destination vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "class Graph[VD, ED] {\n",
    "    def aggregateMessages[Msg: ClassTag](\n",
    "        sendMsg: EdgeContext[VD, ED, Msg] => Unit,\n",
    "        mergeMsg: (Msg, Msg) => Msg,\n",
    "        tripletFields: TripletFields = TripletFields.All)\n",
    "      : VertexRDD[Msg]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The user defined sendMsg function takes an EdgeContext, which exposes the source and destination attributes along with the edge attribute and functions (sendToSrc, and sendToDst) to send messages to the source and destination attributes. Think of sendMsg as the map function in map-reduce. The user defined mergeMsg function takes two messages destined to the same vertex and yields a single message. Think of mergeMsg as the reduce function in map-reduce. The aggregateMessages operator returns a VertexRDD[Msg] containing the aggregate message (of type Msg) destined to each vertex. Vertices that did not receive a message are not included in the returned VertexRDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, aggregateMessages takes an optional tripletFields which indicates what data is accessed in the EdgeContext (i.e., the source vertex attribute but not the destination vertex attribute). The possible options for the tripletFileds are defined in TripletFields and the default value is TripletFields.All which indicates that the user defined sendMsg function may access any of the fields in the EdgeContext. The tripletFields argument can be used to notify GraphX that only part of the EdgeContext will be needed allowing GraphX to select an optimized join strategy. For example if we are computing the average age of the followers of each user we would only require the source field and so we would use TripletFields.Src to indicate that we only require the source field.\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier versions of GraphX we used byte code inspection to infer the TripletFields however we have found that bytecode inspection to be slightly unreliable and instead opted for more explicit user control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inthe following example we use the aggregateMessages operator to compute the average age of the more senior followers of each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.graphx.{Graph, VertexRDD}\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.graphx.util.GraphGenerators\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a graph with \"age\" as the vertex property.\n",
    "// Here we use a random graph for simplicity.\n",
    "val graph: Graph[Double, Int] = \n",
    "    GraphGenerators.logNormalGraph(sc, numVertices = 100).mapVertices( (id, _) => id.toDouble )\n",
    "// Compute the number of older followers and their total age\n",
    "val olderFollowers: VertexRDD[(Int, Double)] = graph.aggregateMessages[(Int, Double)](\n",
    "    triplet => { // Map Function\n",
    "        if (triplet.srcAttr > triplet.dstAttr) {\n",
    "            // Send message to destination vertex containing counter and age\n",
    "            triplet.sendToDst(1, triplet.srcAttr)\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    // Add counter and age\n",
    "    (a, b) => (a._1 + b._1, a._2 + b._2) // Reduce function\n",
    ")\n",
    "// Divide total age by number of older followers to get average age of older followers\n",
    "val avgAgeOfOlderFollowers: VertexRDD[Double] = \n",
    "    olderFollowers.mapValues( (id, value) =>\n",
    "        value match { case (count, totalAge) => totalAge / count } )\n",
    "// Display the results\n",
    "avgAgeOfOlderFollowers.collect.foreach(println(_))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregateMessages operation performs optimally when the messages (and the sums of messages) are constant sized (e.g., floats and addition instead of lists and concatenation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Map Reduce Triplets Transition Guide (Legacy)\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier versions of GraphX neighborhood aggregation was accomplished using the mapReduceTriplets operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "class Graph[VD, ED] {\n",
    "    def mapReduceTriplets[Msg](\n",
    "        map: EdgeTriplet[VD, ED] => Iterator[(VertexId, Msg)],\n",
    "        reduce: (Msg, Msg) => Msg)\n",
    "      : VertexRDD[Msg]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapReduceTriplets operator takes a user defined map function which is applied to each triplet and can yield messages which are aggregated using the user defined reduce function. However, we found the user of the returned iterator to be expensive and it inhibited our ability to apply additional optimizations (e.g., local vertex renumbering). In aggregateMessages we introduced the EdgeContext which exposes the triplet fields and also functions to explicitly send messages to the source and destination vertex. Furthermore we removed bytecode inspection and instead require the user to indicate what fields in the triplet are actually required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code block using mapReduceTriplets:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val graph: Graph[Int, Float] = ...\n",
    "def msgFun(triplet: Triplet[Int, Float]): Iterator[(Int, String)] = {\n",
    "    Iterator((triplet.dstId, \"Hi\"))\n",
    "}\n",
    "def reduceFun(a: String, b: String): String = a + \" \" + b\n",
    "val result = graph.mapReduceTriplets[String](msgFun, reduceFun)\n",
    "```\n",
    "can be rewritten using aggregateMessages as:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "val graph: Graph[Int, Float] = ...\n",
    "def msgFun(triplet: EdgeContext[Int, Float, String]) {\n",
    "    triplet.sendToDst(\"Hi\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "def reduceFun(a: String, b: String): String = a + \" \" + b\n",
    "val result = graph.aggregateMessages[String](msgFun, reduceFun)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing Degree Information\n",
    "\n",
    "A common aggregation task is computing the degree of each vertex: the number of edges adjacent to each vertex. In the context of directed graphs it is often necessary to know the in-degree, out-degree, and the total degree of each vertex. The GraphOps class contains a collection of operators to compute the degrees of each vertex. For example in the following we compute the max in, out, and total degrees:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Define a reduce operation to compute the highest degree vertex\n",
    "def max(a: (VertexId, Int), b: (VertexId, Int)): (VertexId, Int) = {\n",
    "    if (a._2 > b._2) a else b\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Compute the max degrees\n",
    "val maxInDegree: (VertexId, Int) = graph.inDegrees.reduce(max)\n",
    "val maxOutDegree: (VertexId, Int) = graph.outDegrees.reduce(max)\n",
    "val maxDegrees: (VertexId, Int) = graph.degrees.reduce(max)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collecting Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases it may be easier to express computation by collecting neighboring vertices and their attributes at each vertex. This can be easily accomplished using the collectNeighborIds and the collectNeighbors operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "class GraphOps[VD, ED] {\n",
    "    def collectNeighborIds(edgeDirection: EdgeDirection): VertexRDD[Array[VertexId]]\n",
    "    def collectNeighbors(edgeDirection: EdgeDirection): VertexRDD[Array[(VertexId, VD)]]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators can be quite costly as they duplicate information and require substantial communication. If possible try expressing the same computation using the aggregateMessages operator directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caching and Uncaching\n",
    "\n",
    "In Spark, RDDs are not persisted in memory by default. To avoid recomputation, they must be explicitly cached when using them multiple times (see the Spark Programming Guide). Graphs in GraphX behave the same way. **When using a graph multiple times, make sure to call Graph.cache() on it first**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In iterative computations, uncaching may also be necessary for best performance. By default, cached RDDs and graphs will remain in memory until memory pressure forces them to be evicted in LRU order. For iterative computation, intermediate results from previous iterations will fill up the cache. Though they will eventually be evicted, the unnecessary data stored in memory will slow down garbage collection. It would be more efficient to uncache intermediate results as soon as they are no longer necessary. This involves materializing (caching and forcing) a graph or RDD every iteration, uncaching all other datasets, and only using the materialized dataset in future iterations. However, because graphs are composed of multiple RDDs, it can be difficult to unpersist them correctly. **For iterative computation we recommend using the Pregel API, which correctly unpersists intermediate results.\n",
