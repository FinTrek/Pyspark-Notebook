    "Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Kinesis, or TCP sockets, and can be processed using complex algorithms expressed with high level functions like map, reduce, join and window. Finally, processed data can be pushed out to filesystems, databases, and live dashboards.In fact, you can apply Spark's machine learning and graph processing algorithms on data streams.\n",

    "![](9.attach_files/spark_streaming.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, it works as follows. Spark Streaming receives live input data streams and divides the data into batches, which are then processed by the Spark engine to generate the final stream of results in batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/internal_workflow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark Streaming provides a high-level abstraction called discretized stream or DStream, which represents a continuous stream of data. DStreams can be created either from input data streams from sources such as Kafka, Flume, and Kinesis, or by applying high-level operations on other DStreams. Internally, a DStream is represented as a sequence of RDDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows you how to start writing Spark Streaming programs with DStreams. You can write Spark Streaming programs in Scala, Java or Python (introduced in Spark 1.2), Scala version is represented in this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Quick Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go into the details of how to write your own Spark Streaming program, let's take a quick look at what a simple Spark Streaming programs looks like. Let's say we want to count the number of words in text data received from a data server listening on a TCP socket. All you need to do is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the names of the Spark Streaming classes and some implicit conversions from StreamingContext into our environment in order to add useful methods to other classes we need (like DStream). StreamingContext is the main entry point for all streaming functionality. We create a local StreamingContext with two execution threads, and a batch interval of 1 second.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "import org.apache.spark._\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.streaming._\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext._ // not necessary since Spark 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a local StreamingContext with two working thread and batch interval of 1 second.\n",
    "// The master requires 2 cores to prevent from a starvation scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "val conf = new SparkConf().setMaster(\"local[2]\").setAppName(\"NetworkWordCount\")\n",
    "val ssc = new StreamingContext(conf, Seconds(1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this context, we can create a DStream that represents streaming data from a TCP source, specified as hostname (e.g. localhost) and port (e.g. 9999).\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Create a DStream that will connect to hostname:port, like localhost:9999\n",
    "val lines = ssc.socketTextStream(\"localhost\", 9999)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This lines DStream represents the stream of data that will be received from the data server. Each record in this DStream is a line of text. Next, we want to split the lines by space characters into words.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Split each line into words\n",
    "val words = lines.flatMap(_.split(\" \"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "flatMap is a one-to-many DStream operation that creates a new DStream by generating multiple new records from each record in the source DStream. In this case, each line will be split into multiple words and the stream of words is represented as the words DStream. Next, we want to count these words.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Count each word in each batch\n",
    "val pairs = words.map(word => (word, 1))\n",
    "val wordCounts = pairs.reduceByKey(_ + _)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Print the first ten elements of each RDD generated in this DStream to the console\n",
    "wordCounts.print()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The words DStream is further mapped (one-to-one transformation) to a DStream of (word, 1) pairs, which is then reduced to get the frequency of words in each batch of data. Finally, wordCounts.print() will print a few of the counts generated every second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when these lines are executed, Spark Streaming only sets up the computation it will perform when it is started, and no real processing has started yet. To start the processing after all the transformations have been setup, we finally call\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "ssc.start()             // Start the computation\n",
    "ssc.awaitTermination()  // Wait for the computation to terminate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete code can be found in the Spark Straming example NetworkWordCount.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have already downloaded and built Spark, you can run this example as follows. You will first need to run Netcat (a small utility found in most Unix-like systems)as a data server by using\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "nc -lk 9999\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in a different terminal, you can start the example by using\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "./bin/run-example streaming.NetworkWordCount localhost 9999\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, any lines types in the terminal running the netcat server will be counted and printed on screen every second. It will look something like the following.\n",

    "# Basic Concpets\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we move beyond the simple example and elaborate on the basics of Spark Streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linking\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Spark, Spark Streaming is available through Maven Central. To write your own Spark Streaming program, you will have to add the following dependency to your Maven project.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<dependency>\n",
    "    <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>\n",
    "    <artifactId>spark-streaming-2.11</artifactId>\n",
    "    <version>2.0.2</version>\n",
    "</dependency>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For ingesting data from sources like Kafka, Flume, and Kinesis that are not present in the Spark Streaming core API, you will have to add the corresponding artifact spark-streaming-xyz_2.11 to the dependencies. For example, some of the common ones are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/dependencies.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For an up-to-date list, please refer to the Maven repository for the full list of supported sources and artifacts.\n",

    "## Initializing StreamingContext\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize a Spark Streaming program, a StreamingContext object has to be created which is the main entry point of all Spark Streaming functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "A StreamingContext object can be created from a SparkConf object.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "import org.apache.spark._\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.streaming._\n",
    "\n",
    "val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(appName).setMaster(master)\n",
    "val ssc = new StreamingContext(conf, Seconds(1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The appName parameter is a name for your application to show on the cluster UI. master is a Spark, Mesos or YARN cluster URL, or a special \"local[\\*]\" string to run in local mode. In practice, when running on a cluster, you will not want to hardcode master in the program, but rather launch the application with spark-submit and receive it there. However, for local testing and unit tests, you can pass \"local[\\*]\" to run Spark Streaming in-process (detects the number of cores in the local system). Note that this internally creates a SparkContext (starting point of all Spark functionality) which can be accessed as ssc.SparkContext.\n",
    "\n",
    "The batch interval must be set based on the latency requirements of your application and available cluster resources. See the Performance Tuning section for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "A StreamingContext object can also be created from an existing SparkContext object.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.streaming._\n",
    "\n",
    "val sc = ...    // existing SparkContext\n",
    "val ssc = new StreamingContext(sc, Seconds(1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After a context is defined, you have to do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the input sources by creating input DStreams.\n",
    "2. Define the streaming computations by applying transformation and output operations to DStreams.\n",
    "3. Start receiving data and processing it using streamingContext.start().\n",
    "4. Wait for the processing to be stopped (manually or due to any error) using streamingContext.awaitTermination().\n",
    "5. The processing can be manually stopped using streamingContext.stop().\n",
    "\n",
    "**Points to remember:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once a context has been started, no new streaming computations can be set up or added to it.\n",
    "* Once a context has been stopped, it cannot be restarted.\n",
    "* Only one StreamingContext can be active in a JVM at the same time.\n",
    "* stop() on StreamingContext also stops the SparkContext. To stop only the StreamingContext, set the optional parameter of stop() called stopSparkContext to false.\n",
    "* A SparkContext can be re-used to create multiple StreamingContexts, as long as the previous StreamingContext is stopped (without stopping the SparkContext) before the next StreamingContext is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discretized Streams (DStreams)\n",
    "\n",
    "Discretized Stream or DStream is the basic abstraction provided by Spark Streaming. It represents a continuous stream of data, either the input data stream received from source, or the processed data stream generated by transforming the input stream. Internally, a DStream is represented by a continuous series of RDDs, which is Spark's abstraction of an immutable, distributed dataset. Each RDD in a DStream contains data from a certain interval, as shown in the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/DStream.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any operation applied on a DStream translates to operations on the underlying RDDs. For example, in the earlier example of converting a stream of lines to words, the flatMap operation is applied on each RDD in the lines DStream to generate the RDDs of the words DStream. This is shown in the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](9.attach_files/DStream_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These underlying RDD transformations are computed by the Spark engine. The DStream operations hide most of these details and provide the developer with a higher-level API for convenience. These operations are discussed in detail in later sections.\n",
