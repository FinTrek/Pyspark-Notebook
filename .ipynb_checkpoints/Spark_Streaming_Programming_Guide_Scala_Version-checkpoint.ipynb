    "Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Kinesis, or TCP sockets, and can be processed using complex algorithms expressed with high level functions like map, reduce, join and window. Finally, processed data can be pushed out to filesystems, databases, and live dashboards.In fact, you can apply Spark's machine learning and graph processing algorithms on data streams.\n",

    "\n",
    "Internally, it works as follows. Spark Streaming receives live input data streams and divides the data into batches, which are then processed by the Spark engine to generate the final stream of results in batches.\n",

    "\n",
    "Spark Streaming provides a high-level abstraction called discretized stream or DStream, which represents a continuous stream of data. DStreams can be created either from input data streams from sources such as Kafka, Flume, and Kinesis, or by applying high-level operations on other DStreams. Internally, a DStream is represented as a sequence of RDDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows you how to start writing Spark Streaming programs with DStreams. You can write Spark Streaming programs in Scala, Java or Python (introduced in Spark 1.2), Scala version is represented in this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Quick Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go into the details of how to write your own Spark Streaming program, let's take a quick look at what a simple Spark Streaming programs looks like. Let's say we want to count the number of words in text data received from a data server listening on a TCP socket. All you need to do is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the names of the Spark Streaming classes and some implicit conversions from StreamingContext into our environment in order to add useful methods to other classes we need (like DStream). StreamingContext is the main entry point for all streaming functionality. We create a local StreamingContext with two execution threads, and a batch interval of 1 second.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "import org.apache.spark._\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.streaming._\n",
    "import org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext._ // not necessary since Spark 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a local StreamingContext with two working thread and batch interval of 1 second.\n",
    "// The master requires 2 cores to prevent from a starvation scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "val conf = new SparkConf().setMaster(\"local[2]\").setAppName(\"NetworkWordCount\")\n",
    "val ssc = new StreamingContext(conf, Seconds(1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this context, we can create a DStream that represents streaming data from a TCP source, specified as hostname (e.g. localhost) and port (e.g. 9999).\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Create a DStream that will connect to hostname:port, like localhost:9999\n",
    "val lines = ssc.socketTextStream(\"localhost\", 9999)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This lines DStream represents the stream of data that will be received from the data server. Each record in this DStream is a line of text. Next, we want to split the lines by space characters into words.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Split each line into words\n",
    "val words = lines.flatMap(_.split(\" \"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "flatMap is a one-to-many DStream operation that creates a new DStream by generating multiple new records from each record in the source DStream. In this case, each line will be split into multiple words and the stream of words is represented as the words DStream. Next, we want to count these words.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "// Count each word in each batch\n",
    "val pairs = words.map(word => (word, 1))\n",
    "val wordCounts = pairs.reduceByKey(_ + _)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Print the first ten elements of each RDD generated in this DStream to the console\n",
    "wordCounts.print()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The words DStream is further mapped (one-to-one transformation) to a DStream of (word, 1) pairs, which is then reduced to get the frequency of words in each batch of data. Finally, wordCounts.print() will print a few of the counts generated every second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when these lines are executed, Spark Streaming only sets up the computation it will perform when it is started, and no real processing has started yet. To start the processing after all the transformations have been setup, we finally call\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Scala\n",
    "ssc.start()             // Start the computation\n",
    "ssc.awaitTermination()  // Wait for the computation to terminate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete code can be found in the Spark Straming example NetworkWordCount.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have already downloaded and built Spark, you can run this example as follows. You will first need to run Netcat (a small utility found in most Unix-like systems)as a data server by using\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "nc -lk 9999\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in a different terminal, you can start the example by using\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "./bin/run-example streaming.NetworkWordCount localhost 9999\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, any lines types in the terminal running the netcat server will be counted and printed on screen every second. It will look something like the following.\n",
